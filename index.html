    <p> hello </p>
    <p> Git is a free and open source distributed version 
        control system designed to handle everything from 
        small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p> Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning
         fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, 
         CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, 
         convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>
